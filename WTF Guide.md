There are many worlds. They exist along side each other, just beyond our perceptions.
Membranes, thin as the lightest silk separates them, preserving order, allowing our lives
to glide gently over those elsewhere.
On rare occasions, the barrier weakens, and one dimension slips into another. We found such a spot, stabilised it, and wrestled it under our control.
We don't know how much longer we can sustain it. Come gaze upon this wonder.

There's also some flashing lights. Yeah.
