## Limitless Slip Dome

Project for Afrika Burn 2016. A dome style gazebo with around 1500 - 2800 WS2812B LEDs, controlled via Fadecandies.

### From project submission:

The piece will be a net with 1500-2000 LEDs, about 3-4m in diameter suspended on a frame 2m off of the ground. Since the LEDs are fully addressable (NeoPixels!), they can be used to run various visualisations at night. It works really well with sound too, so I'd like to add some speakers (not a dance party level. More like ambient++). Its footprint should be around 5x5m.
